\monstersection{Actions}
\begin{monsteraction}[Longsword]
Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 slashing damage.
\end{monsteraction}
\begin{monsteraction}[Shortbow]
Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 40/160 ft., one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. If its saving throw result is 5 or lower, the poisoned target falls unconscious for the same duration, or until it takes damage or another creature takes an action to shake it awake.
\end{monsteraction}
\begin{monsteraction}[Heart Sight]
The sprite touches a creature and magically knows the creature's current emotional state. If the target fails a DC 10 Charisma saving throw, the sprite also knows the creature's alignment. Celestials, fiends, and undead automatically fail the saving throw.
\end{monsteraction}
\begin{monsteraction}[Invisibility]
The sprite magically turns invisible until it attacks or casts a spell, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the sprite wears or carries is invisible with it.
