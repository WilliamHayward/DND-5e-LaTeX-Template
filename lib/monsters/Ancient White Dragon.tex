\begin{monsteraction}[Ice Walk]
The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra moment.
\end{monsteraction}
\begin{monsteraction}[Legendary Resistance (3/Day)]
If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
\end{monsteraction}
\monstersection{Actions}
\begin{monsteraction}[Multiattack]
The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
\end{monsteraction}
\begin{monsteraction}[Bite]
Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) cold damage.
\end{monsteraction}
\begin{monsteraction}[Claw]
Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.
\end{monsteraction}
\begin{monsteraction}[Tail]
Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.
\end{monsteraction}
\begin{monsteraction}[Frightful Presence]
Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours .
\end{monsteraction}
\begin{monsteraction}[Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6)]
The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 72 (l6d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
