\begin{monsteraction}[Legendary Resistance (3/Day)]
If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
\end{monsteraction}
\monstersection{Actions}
\begin{monsteraction}[Multiattack]
The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
\end{monsteraction}
\begin{monsteraction}[Bite]
Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (2d10 + 10) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) fire damage.
\end{monsteraction}
\begin{monsteraction}[Claw]
Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d6 + 10) slashing damage.

\end{monsteraction}
\begin{monsteraction}[Frightful Presence]
Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
\end{monsteraction}
\begin{monsteraction}[Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6)]
The dragon exhales fire in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 91 (26d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
\end{monsteraction}
\monstersection{Legendary Actions}
\begin{monsteraction}[Detect]
The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
\end{monsteraction}
\begin{monsteraction}[Tail Attack]
The dragon makes a tail attack.
\end{monsteraction}
\begin{monsteraction}[Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions)]
The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 ft. of the dragon must succeed on a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw or take 17 (2d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
\end{monsteraction}
