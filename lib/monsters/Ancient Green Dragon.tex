The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
\end{monsteraction}
\begin{monsteraction}[Bite]
Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage.

\begin{monsteraction}[Frightful Presence]
Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
\end{monsteraction}
\begin{monsteraction}[Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6)]
The dragon exhales poisonous gas in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 77 (22d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
\end{monsteraction}
