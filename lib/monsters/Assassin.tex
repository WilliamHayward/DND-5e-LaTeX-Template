\begin{monsteraction}[Assassinate]
During its first turn, the assassin has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the assassin scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.
\end{monsteraction}
\begin{monsteraction}[Evasion]
If the assassin is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the assassin instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
\end{monsteraction}
\begin{monsteraction}[Sneak Attack (1/Turn)]
The assassin deals an extra 13 (4d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 ft. of an ally of the assassin that isn't incapacitated and the assassin doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
\end{monsteraction}
\monstersection{Actions}
