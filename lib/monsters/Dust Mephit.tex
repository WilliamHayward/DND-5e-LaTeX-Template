\begin{monsteraction}[Death Burst]
When the mephit dies, it explodes in a burst of dust. Each creature within 5 ft. of it must then succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw on each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
\end{monsteraction}
\begin{monsteraction}[Innate Spellcasting (1/Day)]
The mephit can innately cast sleep, requiring no material components. Its innate spellcasting ability is Charisma.
\end{monsteraction}
\monstersection{Actions}
\begin{monsteraction}[Claws]
Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage.
\end{monsteraction}
\begin{monsteraction}[Blinding Breath (Recharge 6)]
The mephit exhales a 15-foot cone of blinding dust. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
\end{monsteraction}
\begin{monsteraction}[Variant: Summon Mephits (1/Day)]
The mephit has a 25 percent chance of summoning 1d4 mephits of its kind. A summoned mephit appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other mephits. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.
