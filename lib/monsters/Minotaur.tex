If the minotaur moves at least 10 ft. straight toward a target and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 ft. away and knocked prone.
\end{monsteraction}
\begin{monsteraction}[Labyrinthine Recall]
The minotaur can perfectly recall any path it has traveled.

\begin{monsteraction}[Reckless]
